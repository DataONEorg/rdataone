\description{
Obscures the x509 certificate that CILogon installs, effectively making future
interactions with the DataONE services public/anonymous.  This function simple renames an
existing certificate file to a known location, allowing 'public' operations.  Note, when the 
client certificate is obscured via the renaming, you will not be able to create objects in 
DataONE, or utilize any other methods that require authentication.

\code{\link{restoreCert}} is this method's inverse operation
