\description{
A convenience method to take you to the CILogon download page:  
"https://cilogon.org/?skin=DataONE. Logging into CILogon will allow
you to download your X.509 certificate to your local computer.  Typically,
the certificate is saved in the default Globus location for certificates 
(\code{\link{getCertLocation}}) and once it is there, the \code{'dataone'} 
package will use the certificate for all authenticated operations.  Deleting 
the certificate file is the equivalent of logging out.
